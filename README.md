What is the point of RemindMeBot?

RemindMeBot was made as a way to remind the user about a comment or thread for later use.
For example, someone on AskReddit posts a list of cool movies to watch. Although you don't have time to watch it now, you make a comment to remember to view a movie from the list later.
However, you forget about the comment you made because you always find the cool things before sleeping and you have a short attention span to view your previously made comments.
Think of RemindMe! as an improved and automatic "saved" for later
