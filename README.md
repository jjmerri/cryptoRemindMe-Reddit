Base code was copied from https://github.com/SIlver--/remindmebot-reddit then upgraded to use current versions of PRAW and Python.

What is the point of cryptoRemindMeBot?

cryptoRemindMeBot was made as a way to remind the user about a comment or thread for later use.
For example, someone on /r/ripple makes a commment that they are going to go streaking in the streets when the price of XRP reaches $2. You can make a comment with the command "cryptoRemindMe! XRP $2" and you will get a PM from cryptoRemindMeBot when the price of XRP reaches $2. All price data is pulled using the CryptoCompare api.

The following crypto is supported:

["ADA","BCH","BCN","BTC","BTG","DASH","ETC","ETH","LSK","LTC","NEO","QTUM","STEEM","XEM","XLM","XMR","XRB","XRP","ZEC"]
